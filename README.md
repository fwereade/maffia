I wrote this long ago. I didn't really know much about how to program. But it
*was* a pretty cool game.

It was originally released with a poorly-chosen license, which dissuaded some
wonderful person who was once planning to update the code for modern macs.

Posting it under the unlicense will hopefully rectify this situation if anyone
in the future is motivated to do the same.

If you want to play it there's a version built for old old Mac OS X at
http://macintoshgarden.org/games/maffia â€“ which is in fact where I reclaimed
this source from.

I'm afraid I have no idea what happened to the 1.0.2 source code, or what the
differences are between this version (apparently 1.0.1) and that.
